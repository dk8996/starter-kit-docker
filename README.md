# Starter Kit with Docker
Starter Kit for Truffle, Ganache, React enable via Docker.

Inspired by [Master Blockchain Step-By-Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCE-fQJAVQ4) from Dapp University.

## Intro
There are two dockerfiles, one for the truffle development tools and React, and another for ganache-cli. We will use the docker compose file to start and stop the two containers.
